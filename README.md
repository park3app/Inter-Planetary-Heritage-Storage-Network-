# Park-3

## ETH HACK FS 2023 <br>

<b>Park 3 is a public data storage and verification hyperstructure.
</b>


A “Hyperstructure” is built to run in perpetuity on distributed systems.  
<br>
<br>

## Lets Take Web 3 Outside.

First we Establish a standard for the State of "Physical Objects" in "Reality"
<br>
<br>
<b>GOAL: Create a publically verifiable STATE in publically accessible SPACETIME.</b>
<br>

1. Host Video on IPFS of Public Parks and Public Spaces. <br>
2. Create a "Statement Of Fact" declaring attributes and/or contents of the public place.<br>
3. If the Statement Of Fact becomes invalid, any user can notify the hyperstructure, and trigger a human review of STATE.<br>
   <br>
   <b>Making Use Of:</b><br>
   IPFS For Storage<br>
   UMA Oracle For Natural Language Questions<br>
   Livepeer Studio For Video Asset Management<br>
   Polygon Network For Speed and Affordable web3 utilities<br>

### CULTURAL PRESERVATION USE CASE:

<br>
<b>The people of Quintana Roo wish to preserve their cultural heritage and insure a Mural and Statue are preserved.</b> 
<br>
<br>
- Document the culturally significant attributes of the place. (Ancient Theatre) (Mayan Buildings)<br>
<br>
- Preserve Immutable Video History and Statements Of Fact on Park3<br>
<br>
- Allow global community to interact with or add value to the preserved STATE.<br>
<br>
- Provide ReFi solutions, KPI Options, and Insurance verification and payouts that support the preservation of the culture. 
<br><br><br>

<br>
<b>PROBLEMS FOR PUBLIC PARKS ADMINISTRATORS</b> <br><br>
    •    Public Parks and spaces have untapped potential and <u>need trusted data</u>. <br>
    •    In Los Angeles a park is being built with Original Art and Data in QR codes. <br>
    •    City Lawyers want a solution that can not be corrupted or hacked, and if ever compromised can be restored automatically. 
<br>

## Why are public spaces ideal for off-chain verification and Hyperstructures?

- Public Parks are Accessible to humans without red tape, ticketing, oversight etc.<br>
- Open near 365 days per year in most cases<br>
- A shared responsibility of a geographic community<br>
- Large Value in Real Estate Holdings <br>
- Legal Obligations for administrators<br><br>
